Project 1 demo can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSUd3sx91NA&feature=youtu.be).

This project is using Maven. Deployment can be done the same way as instructed.

1. Clone the repo.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs122b-spring20-team-132.git
    ```
2. Inside the repo, where  pom.xml is, build the .war file.
    ```bash
    mvn package
    ```
3. Copy the newly built .war file to the tomcat webapps folder.

I am the only person in this group/team. I did all the work.
